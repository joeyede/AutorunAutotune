# Running Standalone

## Prerequisites
- You will need to know you nightscout URL and API secret. 
- You will need to have setup a profile called "baseline" 
- You will need Git installed to download this repository. 
- You will need to have Docker installed in order to build and run the Docker image.  See https://www.docker.com/ for more info.

## Getting Started:
- Create a directory you want to run this in. 
- Change to that directory. 
- Pull this repository from git
- Change into the newly created git clone.

e.g. on Linux:
```shell script
$ mkdir testAutorunAuto
$ cd testAutorunAutot/
$ git clone https://github.com/joeyede/AutorunAutotune.git
$ cd AutorunAutotune/
````

##### Update docker file

You will now need to **modify** the Dockerfile.

 - Open the file called "Dockerfile" in a text editor
 - Find the line that starts "RUN echo "ERROR - You need to remove this line and edit the next lines..." and delete it
 - Replace *"missing"* with your API Secret
 - Replace *"https://yousite.herokuapp.com"* with your nightscout URL.  **be sure not to have a '/' at the end of the line'
 - Replace *"Europe/London"* with the correct timezone.  You can find yours here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
 - Set UAM_BASAL to "true" or "false" to indicate if you want all Unanounced Meals detected to count as basal see [autotune docs](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Customize-Iterate/autotune.html) for more details on this. 
 - Set TUNE to "true" or "false" to indicate if you want inslulin curves to be tuned. Again see [autotune docs](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Customize-Iterate/autotune.html) for info. 


This is the section you are looking for: 
```dockerfile
RUN echo "ERROR - You need to remove this line and edit the next lines with your personal API Secret and site URL; whether you want UAM counted as Basal; and whether to tune the insulin curve" ; exit 1
# Personal stuff:
ENV API_SECRET missing
ENV SITE_URL https://yousite.herokuapp.com
# Set Your Time zone
ENV TZ Europe/London  
```
Finally build the docker file and then run the new image:

```shell script
$ docker build . -t autot
$ docker run autot
```

If everything works you should have a new profile "OpenAPS Autosync" activated.

While running it will spit out lots of text here is what the tail of a run looks like:

```text

## Automating this
Use your automation tool of choice to run the command:
```shell script
$ docker run autot
```
at a time of your choice (I use 2am)
